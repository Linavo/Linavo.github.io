        <h2><br /><br />Swipe Me Hunger Mobile Website</h2>

        <p class="p-container">
          <br />
          Have you ever visited a website on your smartphone and didn’t have an
          enjoyable experience? Many times the images that look great on the
          desktop version might become too overwhelming on your tiny mobile
          screen. The navigation menu might look displaced, or the texts may
          take up way too much space than is necessary. For the Swipe Me
          Hunger’s website, this was the case as their mobile version of their
          website wasn’t user friendly.<br /><br />
          Swipe Me Hunger is a website that is dedicated to helping students
          with food insecurity. Food insecurity is a significant issue for
          students who are struggling to balance their health while attending
          college. Swipe Me Hunger provides resources to students who have low
          income, or don't have the transportation to purchase food.
          <br /><br />
          As a user experience designer, I created a mockup of the mobile design
          of the Swipe Me Hunger’s website. There were blocks of white space and
          the images were too big in proportion to the mobile screen. Users were
          forced to scroll much longer to accommodate the inconvenient mobile
          design. Also, the text sizing looked much larger on their mobile
          version in comparison to their desktop website.<br />
          <br />
          To find a solution to these problems, I removed the unnecessary color
          blocks, images, and had re-sized the entire page to have a proper
          version of the website. My mockup provides the most significant
          information first and the content is visibly more clear.
