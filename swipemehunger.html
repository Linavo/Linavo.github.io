        <h2><br /><br />Swipe Me Hunger Mobile Website</h2>

        <p class="p-container">
          <br />
          Have you ever visited a website on your smartphone and didn’t have an
          enjoyable experience? Many times the images that look great on the
          desktop version might become too overwhelming on your tiny screen. Or
          maybe the navigation is completely everywhere and the texts are just
          taking up way too much space than is necessary.<br />
          <br />
          For the Swipe Me Hunger’s website, this was the case as their mobile
          version of their website wasn’t too user friendly. As a user
          experience designer, I created a much pleasing visual design using
          figma to properly address the issues. Swipe Me Hunger’s website didn’t
          translate well when using a smartphone as many of the blocks of white
          space and images were way too big in proportion to the screen. Users
          would have to scroll much longer to accommodate the inconvenient
          mobile design. Not only that, text sizing looks much larger on their
          mobile version.<br />
          <br />
          The overall sizing of the mobile website proved to steer readers away,
          thus, defeating the purpose of the whole website that is helping
          others not have food scarcity. To combat this issue, I removed
          unnecessary color blocks, images, and re-sized the entire page to have
          a minimized version of the website. Not only is the most significant
          information now the first thing the user sees, the navigation and
          content are now visible.
