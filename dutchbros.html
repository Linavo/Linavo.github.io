        <p class="p-container">
          <br />
          Have you ever visited a website and wondered, “Why is it so difficult
          for me to do what I need?”. Some of your favorite brands might have
          functioning websites, but many times improvement can make your love
          for them even greater.<br />
          <br />
          As a user experience designer, my job is to not only research ways to
          create better usability but to implement those ideas as well. There
          were a few issues with the original Dutch Bro’s website such as images
          and blank spaces that had taken up too much room on the website.
          Another issue that was pointed out was the amount of bright colors
          that was not appealing to mature audiences. I had kept the color
          themes more muted for better visibility, and removed excess images to
          allow the website to look more appeased. I rearranged the empty space
          to allow users to scroll through the website without feeling like it
          took forever as well.<br />
          <br />
          By simplifying their current website, it gave it a better interaction
          and user design.
