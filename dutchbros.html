          <h2>Dutch Bro's Website Redesign</h2>

          <p>
            <br />
            Have you ever visited a website and wondered, “Why is it so
            difficult for me to do what I need?”. Some of your favorite brands
            might have functioning websites, but many times improvement can make
            your love for them even greater.<br />
            <br />
            As a user experience designer, my job is to not only research ways
            to create better usability but to implement those ideas as well.
            There were a few issues with the original Dutch Bro’s website such
            as images and blank spaces that had taken up too much room on the
            website. Another issue that was pointed out was the amount of bright
            colors that was not appealing to mature audiences. I had kept the
            color themes more muted for better visibility, and removed excess
            images to allow the website to look more appeased. I rearranged the
            empty space to allow users to scroll through the website without
            feeling like it took forever as well.<br />
            <br />
            By simplifying their current website, it gave it a better
            interaction and user design.
