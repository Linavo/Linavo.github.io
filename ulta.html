          <h2>Ulta's Content Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            <br />

            Every major corporation always has a great content strategist. Many
            may take on several roles within the company or be specialized in
            content strategy itself. For my proposal to Ulta Beauty, I broke
            down the many factors that contributed to the company's marketing
            plan. The proposal itself provides the interactor profile, which
            identifies the general demographic of consumers at the company, and
            content fitness.<br />
            <br />
            One of my most important tasks was to analyze the company's greatest
            competitors, Sephora and Sally’s Beauty Supply. For this project, I
            went on each competitor’s website and compared their features,
            targeted audiences, and content with Ulta’s. After gaining insight
            of the various similarities and differences they all have, I was
            able to make the conclusion that Ulta’s greatest strengths relied on
            maintaining current trends. Ulta has significantly gained more
            customers in these past few years due to their wide audience of
            customers.
            <br />
            <br />For my proposal, I demonstrated great knowledge on how to
            properly analyze a company and their content strategies.
