          to view <i>Ulta's Content Strategy</i><br />
          <br />
          Every respective company has a great content strategist. Many may take
          on several roles within the company or be specialized in content
          strategy itself. For my proposed content strategy for Ulta, I explored
          the many factors that contribute to a great plan. The proposal itself
          provides the interactor profile, which identifies the general
          demographic of people who are consumers at the company, and content
          fitness.<br />
          <br />
          I’ve also gone so far as to dig a little deeper and understand more
          about their competitors, Sephora and Sally’s Beauty Supply. For this
          project, I went on each competitor’s website and compared their
          features, targeted audiences, and content with Ulta’s. After gaining
          insight of the various similarities and differences they all have, I
          was able to make the conclusion that Ulta’s greatest strengths relied
          on maintaining current trends comparatively to the other two major
          corporations. Both Sephora and Sally’s Beauty Supply had maintained a
          similar image in the past years; although it hasn’t significantly
          decreased their consumers, Ulta has significantly gained more
          customers in these past years. In my personal experiences, I loved to
          shop at all three of the stores for different products, but Ulta had
          always been the store I knew I could rely on for anything. Throughout
          my proposed content strategy, I specified how Ulta’s wide variety of
          products may cater to a bigger audience than their audiences. <br />
          <br />Not only that, it gives them the flexibility to advertise
          towards different minority groups. Great companies are always
          revisiting their marketing strategies and user experience approaches
          to cater to the public.
