          <h2>Ulta's Content Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            <br />

            Every respective company has a great content strategist. Many may
            take on several roles within the company or be specialized in
            content strategy itself. For my proposed content strategy for Ulta,
            I explored the many factors that contribute to a great plan. The
            proposal itself provides the interactor profile, which identifies
            the general demographic of people who are consumers at the company,
            and content fitness.<br />
            <br />
            I’ve also gone so far as to dig a little deeper and understand more
            about their competitors, Sephora and Sally’s Beauty Supply. For this
            project, I went on each competitor’s website and compared their
            features, targeted audiences, and content with Ulta’s. After gaining
            insight of the various similarities and differences they all have, I
            was able to make the conclusion that Ulta’s greatest strengths
            relied on maintaining current trends comparatively to the other two
            major corporations. Both Sephora and Sally’s Beauty Supply had
            maintained a similar image in the past years; although it hasn’t
            significantly decreased their consumers, Ulta has significantly
            gained more customers in these past years. In my personal
            experiences, I loved to shop at all three of the stores for
            different products, but Ulta had always been the store I knew I
            could rely on for anything. Throughout my proposed content strategy,
            I specified how Ulta’s wide variety of products may cater to a
            bigger audience than their audiences. <br />
            <br />Not only that, it gives them the flexibility to advertise
            towards different minority groups. Great companies are always
            revisiting their marketing strategies and user experience approaches
            to cater to the public.
