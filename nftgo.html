            As cryptocurrency has exploded in the past decade, NFT’s have become
            the next big thing. They are known as 'non-fungible tokens' and are
            represented by digital artwork. Their purpose is to contain monetary
            worth and may even grant you entry to exclusive memberships. Many
            people aren’t aware of what an NFT is or what it has to offer. NFTGo
            is dedicated to informing readers on the amazing benefits of joining
            the NFT world.<br />
            <br />
            I created NFTGo in order to inform people of the topic and to create
            a website that my persona would most likely develop. The website
            informs readers on the most popular NFT chains, the latest events in
            the Los Angeles area, and more. Instead of promoting the latest NFT
            purchases, it is used as an informational platform for others to
            connect with one another.<br />
            <br />
            By implementing my web design, technical writing, and user
            experience skills, I’ve been able to successfully build a website
            specifically targeted for NFT networking. Each page was carefully
            constructed to have their own topics for viewers to browse. To
            engage readers, I was able to display my storytelling skills to keep
            their attention on each page. Most importantly, I used my user
            experience skills to determine the usability layout and features of
            my website.
