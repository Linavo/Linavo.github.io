            As cryptocurrency has exploded in the past decade, NFT’s have become
            the next big thing. They are known as non-fungible tokens; they
            represent digital artwork that has monetary worth and may even grant
            you entry to exclusive memberships. Many people aren’t very aware of
            what an NFT is or what it offers. NFTGo is dedicated to informing
            new and current readers on the amazing benefits of joining the
            virtual world.<br />
            <br />
            I created NFTGo in order to inspire others, and to create a website
            that my created persona would most likely develop. I created a
            website that not only provides awareness to NFTs, but a website that
            informs readers on the most popular NFT chains, latest events in the
            Los Angeles area, and more. Instead of being a website that promotes
            purely the latest NFT purchases, it is used as an informational
            platform for others to connect with one another.<br />
            <br />
            By implementing my web design, technical writing, and user
            experience skills, I’ve been able to successfully build a website
            specifically targeted for NFT networking. Each page was carefully
            constructed to have their own topics for viewers to browse. To
            engage readers, I was able to display my storytelling skills to keep
            their attention on each page. Most importantly, I used my user
            experience skills to determine the usability layout and features of
            my website.
