          <h2>Social Media & Cyber Security Website</h2>
          <p>
            <br />

            As social media platforms have become one of our main sources of
            communication, it is important to be informed on how to protect
            ourselves from others on the internet. For this project, I decided
            to dedicate it to both social media and cyber security.<br /><br />
            My roles to this website includes being the UX designer, content
            creator, and website designer. To better relay the information to my
            readers, I needed to figure out the best layout for my website. For
            an example, in the navigation bar you might have noticed that the
            link containing how to protect ourselves from attacks is closer to
            the end. By providing the background information on how privacy
            breaches can harm you first, viewers are able to better understand
            how the prevention works.<br /><br />

            For each topic, I made it a priority to have people from most ages
            understand my writing. Cyber security is such an important topic in
            this day and age; as our society is growing closer to having
            everything become digital, privacy breaches are bound to happen. As
            a website designer, I first wireframed how I wanted the website to
            look. Squarespace has allowed me to take my prototype to life by
            using their preset features to build the website.<br /><br />
            I created this website because I believe cyber security breaching is
            a major topic that many of us internet users need to be more
            informed on.
