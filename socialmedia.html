          <br />
          As we transition our entire lives into the digital universe, privacy
          breaches are bound to be in our foreseeable futures. For this project,
          I had decided to dedicate social media and cyber security as the main
          focal point. My contributions to the website were primarily UX design,
          content creator, and website designer. Juggling these three roles
          allowed me to gain a better insight of how to properly present a
          pleasing, yet, informative resource for others to view. As a UX
          designer, I needed to figure out the best layout and most important
          information that needed to be displayed. <br /><br />
          I was researching on this topic, I purposefully provided information
          first then put the FAQ’s at the end of the navigation bar. When users
          first come to my website, they will find that it is extremely simple
          yet effective because it is easy to use. The FAQ’s were placed at the
          end of the page for readers to first gather information in the
          previous navigation links.<br /><br />
          For each page, I wrote the information as readable as possible so
          people of most ages may understand this very important topic. Cyber
          security is such an important topic in this day and age; as our
          society is growing closer to having everything become digital, privacy
          breaches are bound to happen. As a website designer, I first
          wireframed how I wanted the website to look and then took my
          visualizations to life with Square Space. Square space allowed me to
          properly take my prototype to life by using their preset features that
          were attractive to me.<br /><br />
          Social media and cyber security is a major topic that many of us
          internet users need to be informed on. Making my website not only
          spreads awareness to others, but it can be readable to a wide variety
          of audiences.
