          <h2>Social Media & Cyber Security Website</h2>
          <p>
            <br />

            As we transition our entire lives into the digital universe, privacy
            breaches are bound to be in our foreseeable futures. For this
            project, I had decided to dedicate social media and cyber security
            as the main focal point. My contributions to the website were
            primarily UX design, content creator, and website designer. Juggling
            these three roles allowed me to gain a better insight of how to
            properly present a pleasing, yet, informative resource for others to
            view. As a UX designer, I needed to figure out the best layout and
            most important information that needed to be displayed. <br /><br />
            I was researching on this topic, I purposefully provided information
            first then put the FAQ’s at the end of the navigation bar. When
            users first come to my website, they will find that it is extremely
            simple yet effective because it is easy to use. The FAQ’s were
            placed at the end of the page for readers to first gather
            information in the previous navigation links.<br /><br />
            For each page, I wrote the information as readable as possible so
            people of most ages may understand this very important topic. Cyber
            security is such an important topic in this day and age; as our
            society is growing closer to having everything become digital,
            privacy breaches are bound to happen. As a website designer, I first
            wireframed how I wanted the website to look and then took my
            visualizations to life with Square Space. Square space allowed me to
            properly take my prototype to life by using their preset features
            that were attractive to me.<br /><br />
            Social media and cyber security is a major topic that many of us
            internet users need to be informed on. Making my website not only
            spreads awareness to others, but it can be readable to a wide
            variety of audiences.
